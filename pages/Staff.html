  <p id=para1> FTB's Founder/CEO Braden Hautman.  Braden grew up around farming his whole life.  His mother and father were organic enthusits with his mother being a foods teacher at the local school.
  Braden was raised with the mentality of growing your own food/ingredients would yield a fresher better flavor.  When Braden became interested in the craft beer movment, in the early 2010's, he realized that hops really
make the difference in the beer flavor.  As the craft beer boom became bigger and bigger he decided to start his own hop farm.  With 100 acres of farming land ready to go for him, Braden started on his journey in 2017.
Fast forward 3 years and Farm to Bar is fully functioning USDA organic hop farm with a full brewery and tasting room.  Braden is very active in the day to day routines at the farm and is often found wandering the hop farm
admiring the beautiful hops that he loves to much. </p>
