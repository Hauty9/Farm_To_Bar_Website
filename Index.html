  <p id=para1>  Farm to Bar (FTB) is a 100 acre hop farm located about 45 mins south of the twin cities in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lonsdale,+MN+55046/@44.4801872,-93.4581424,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87f6678dfe4a5b13:0x7ce9f1cd04fa51!8m2!3d44.4802412!4d-93.4285587"target="_blank">Lonsdale</a> MN.
  FTB is unique in that we are able to grow hops year round with our on-site green house.  This will allow us to
  provide fresh hops year round.  We like our hops to be brewed into beer as soon as they are ready so we like
  to provide local breweries with our hops.  Onsite we have a "tasting room" where brewers can try our hops.  We also
  have a full brewery for any brewer to rent to try out hops with their receipes.</p>

  <p id=para1>FTB grows <a href="https://www.usda.gov/"target="_blank">USDA</a> organic hops.  We belive in clean farming procedures and we don's use chemicals to grow our hops.
  This is an very important part of FTB and we take pride in clean living and our renewable energy sources we have on
  the farm.  Along with the traditional hop varieties, FTB is always striving to create new and exciting varieties.  Minnesota
  has never been known to be a big producer of hops and we aim to change that.  We belive that Minnesota has very unique
  soil that gives our hops a bolder richer flavor.  We are confident you will taste the difference!   </p>
