<h1> Hops We Are Currently Growing </h1>



<body id="Hops">

<p id="para1">
  Here at FTB we grow <u>many</u> varieties of hops.  We are unique in that we were able to obtain hop varieties that
  are not able to be grown anywhere but the farm that created them.  How are we able to do this you ask?
  We have devolped a <s>relationship</s> partnership with other hop farms that hold the rights to certain varieties
  of hops.  This includes but not limited to <a href= "http://www.hopslist.com/hops/dual-purpose-hops/mosaic/" target="_blank" >Mosaic</a>, <a href="http://www.hopslist.com/hops/dual-purpose-hops/simcoe/" target="_blank">Simcoe</a>, <a href="http://www.hopslist.com/hops/dual-purpose-hops/citra/" target="_blank">Citra</a>,<a href="http://www.hopslist.com/hops/dual-purpose-hops/galaxy/" target="_blank">Galaxy</a> just to name a few.  We also are working
  to develop our own varieties that can be found exclusivly at our farm and our partners farms.  See the list
  below of the current hops we are growing.</p>
